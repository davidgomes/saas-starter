tldr: The  file was refactored to improve readability and
  organization. This involved using the  utility for class names and
  extracting the SWR fallback configuration into a separate function.
overview: "The user initiated a request to refactor . The
  primary goal was to enhance the file's readability, organization, and
  maintainability. After reviewing the existing code, data fetching patterns,
  and project conventions (like the  utility), the refactoring focused on
  two key areas: utilizing the  utility for cleaner className merging and
  extracting the SWR fallback data configuration into a separate, more readable
  function. While initial thoughts included optimizing data fetching with
  , it was determined that  already calls
  internally, making a different approach to parallelization less impactful. The
  final implementation successfully improved the code's structure and adherence
  to project standards without altering its core functionality."
