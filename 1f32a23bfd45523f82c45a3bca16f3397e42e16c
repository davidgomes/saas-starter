tldr: I refactored  to improve its readability and organization.
  This involved using the  utility for class names and extracting the SWR
  fallback configuration into a dedicated function.
overview: The user requested a refactor of . I began by
  reviewing the existing file, related database queries, and project-specific
  rules and component patterns to understand the current implementation and
  identify areas for improvement. I found opportunities to enhance code
  organization, readability, and maintainability. Specifically, I decided to use
  the  utility for constructing class names, as per project conventions,
  and to extract the SWR fallback configuration into a dedicated function. While
  I initially considered optimizing data fetching with  to avoid
  waterfalls, I realized that  internally calls ,
  making direct parallelization less impactful. Therefore, the refactoring
  focused on improving the code's structure and clarity, resulting in a cleaner
  and more maintainable  file.
