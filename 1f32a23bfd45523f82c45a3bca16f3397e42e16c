tldr: The user requested to refactor . The assistant analyzed
  the file and related codebase patterns, identifying several opportunities to
  improve performance, code organization, and readability, including optimizing
  data fetching and using utility functions.
overview: 'The user initiated a request to refactor . Following
  a "Selective Autonomy" approach, the assistant independently analyzed the
  existing  file, project-wide conventions, and data fetching
  patterns. It identified several key areas for improvement: optimizing data
  fetching to avoid duplicate calls, enhancing code organization using the
   utility, improving type safety, and extracting SWRConfig setup for
  better readability. While concurrent data fetching was considered, the
  assistant noted the nested nature of  within ,
  leading to a pivot towards other optimizations like extracting configurations
  and utilizing helper functions. The conversation concluded with the
  identification of these refactoring opportunities, setting the stage for
  implementation.'
