tldr: The user asked for a greeting. The assistant calculated the current day of
  the week (Sunday, November 16, 2025) based on a given date and then greeted
  the user by name and the day.
overview: 'The user initiated the conversation with a simple "say hi" request.
  The assistant, following specific instructions, needed to greet the user by
  name ("David") and include the current day of the week. To achieve this, the
  assistant manually calculated that November 16, 2025, falls on a Sunday,
  starting from the known fact that January 1, 2025, was a Wednesday. After this
  calculation, the assistant delivered a personalized greeting: "Happy Sunday,
  David! 👋 How can I help you today?".'
