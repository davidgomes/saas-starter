overview: The user wanted to refactor  and  to
  improve code quality. The assistant began by reading both files to understand
  their current structure. It then proposed a series of refactoring tasks,
  including extracting SWR fallback configuration and adding type interfaces for
  , and for , extracting session cookie refresh
  logic, route protection logic, and adding type constants. The assistant then
