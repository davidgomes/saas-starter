tldr: The user requested to add comments to the  file. The
  assistant successfully added explanatory comments to key constants, the
  session refresh function, and the session refresh logic within the middleware
  function.
overview: The user wanted to improve the readability and understanding of the
   file by adding comments. The assistant proceeded by first
  reading the file and then applying a series of patches. Comments were added to
  define the purpose of session-related constants, explain the
  function, and clarify the logic for refreshing sessions specifically on GET
  requests within the main  function. The goal was to ensure future
  readers could quickly grasp the protection and session management logic.
