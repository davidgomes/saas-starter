tldr: The user requested to add comments to the  file. The
  assistant successfully added explanatory comments to constants, the
   function, and the main  function to improve code
  readability and understanding of the session management logic.
overview: The user wanted to improve the readability of the  file
  by adding comments. The assistant identified key sections, including constant
  definitions, the  function, and the core  logic,
  to add explanations. The process involved several iterative patch applications
  to add and refine comments. This included clarifying the purpose of session
  cookie names, protected routes, session lifetimes, and the session refresh
  mechanism, specifically noting that refreshes occur only on safe GET requests.
  The outcome is a more clearly documented  file.
