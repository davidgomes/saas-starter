tldr: The user requested to refactor . The assistant improved
  the file's organization, readability, and maintainability by extracting
  constants, font configuration, and SWR config, as well as enhancing type
  safety and cleaning up JSX.
overview: The user wanted to refactor  to enhance its code
  quality. The assistant approached this by first analyzing the existing file
  and then proposing a structured refactoring plan. The plan involved extracting
  various configurations and constants (metadata, viewport, SWR config, CSS
  classes) into dedicated variables, organizing the code into logical sections,
  improving type safety by defining a  type, and simplifying
  the JSX. The outcome was a more organized, readable, and maintainable
   file, while retaining all original functionality.
