tldr: The user wanted to add comments to the  file. The assistant
  successfully added inline comments to describe the constants, helper
  functions, and the overall intent of the middleware, making the authentication
  flow easier to understand.
overview: The user's intent was to improve the readability of the
   file by adding comments. The assistant approached this by
  reading the  file and then applying a patch to insert
  descriptive inline comments. These comments clarify the purpose of constants,
  helper functions like , , and
  , as well as the main  function and its .
  This makes the authentication flow within the file easier to follow. The task
  was completed without running automated tests, as they were not part of the
  initial request.
