tldr: The user requested to refactor the  and
  files. I identified several areas for improvement in both files and
  implemented changes to enhance error handling, code organization, and session
  management.
overview: The user wanted to refactor  and  to
  improve code quality and maintainability. I started by analyzing the existing
  code in both files, identifying issues like missing error handling in
  , hardcoded CSS classes, and suboptimal session management in
  . For , I introduced error handling for data
  fetching in  and organized theme-related CSS classes into a
  dedicated object. For , I extracted session and cookie
  configurations into constants, refined the session refresh logic to handle
  errors gracefully, and created a helper function for redirects. After some
  initial tool issues, the  file was successfully updated using a
  shell command.
