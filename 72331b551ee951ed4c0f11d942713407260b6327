  files. The assistant successfully refactored both files, significantly
  improving code organization, readability, and maintainability by extracting
  constants, creating utility functions, and enhancing documentation.
overview: The user initiated a request to refactor the  and
   files to enhance code quality and maintainability. The
  assistant began by thoroughly examining the existing code in both files, along
  with related context files, to formulate a comprehensive refactoring plan. For
  , the key decisions involved extracting the SWR configuration
  into a dedicated  component, defining constants for CSS classes,
  and introducing clear section headers and JSDoc comments for better
  readability. In , the approach focused on centralizing
  constants like  and , and extracting
  reusable utility functions for tasks such as route checking and session
  refreshing. Although the assistant initially faced challenges with the
   tool, it successfully pivoted to using  commands to write
  the refactored content. The outcome was a significant improvement in code
  organization, readability, and maintainability for both files, confirmed by
  subsequent linting checks.
