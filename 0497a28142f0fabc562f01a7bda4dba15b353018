tldr: The user requested a refactor of . The agent identified
  redundant data fetching and inefficient SWR fallback configuration. The plan
  is to create a new helper function in  to fetch user and team data
  efficiently, then update  to use this helper.
overview: The user initiated a refactoring task for . The agent
  analyzed the existing code and found that  was being called
  redundantly, leading to inefficient data fetching within the SWR fallback
  mechanism. To address this, the agent decided to create a new helper function
  in  that will efficiently fetch both user and team data, avoiding
  the duplicate  call. This helper will then be integrated into
   to streamline data retrieval and improve overall code
  organization. The refactoring is currently in progress, focusing on the
  creation of this helper function.
