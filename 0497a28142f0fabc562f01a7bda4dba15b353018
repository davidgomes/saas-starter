tldr: The conversation focused on refactoring  to optimize data
  fetching for SWR fallback. The main goal was to eliminate redundant
   calls by fetching the user once and reusing that data for
  subsequent team lookups.
overview: The user initiated a refactoring task for . The
  primary intent was to optimize data fetching within the SWR fallback
  mechanism, specifically to address redundant calls to . The initial
  implementation in  was calling  directly and then
  again indirectly within . The approach involved first
  introducing a new helper function, , in
  to fetch team data given a user ID, thus avoiding the internal
  call. Subsequently,  was refactored to create a
   function. This function now fetches the user once,
  obtains a user promise, and then chains a team promise that depends on the
  user promise. This ensures  is called only once, and the team data
  is fetched efficiently using the  helper. This change
  maintains the SWR fallback pattern while significantly improving data fetching
  performance and code organization.
