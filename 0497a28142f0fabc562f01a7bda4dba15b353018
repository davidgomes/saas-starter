tldr: The user requested to refactor . The assistant identified
  performance issues with redundant data fetching and plans to optimize the data
  fetching strategy and improve code organization.
overview: The user initiated a refactoring task for . The
  assistant, operating under a "Selective Autonomy" workflow, independently
  analyzed the existing code and identified several areas for improvement. Key
  issues include redundant calls to  within the SWR fallback, leading
  to inefficient data fetching. The assistant plans to optimize the data
  fetching strategy to avoid client-side waterfalls and improve overall code
  organization. While concurrent fetching was initially considered, the
  dependency of  on  necessitates a different
  optimization approach, such as fetching the user once and then using that data
  to fetch the team, or refactoring  to accept a user
  parameter. The next steps involve implementing these optimizations.
