tldr: The user requested to refactor  to improve performance and
  code organization. The agent identified redundant data fetching due to
   being called multiple times and introduced helper functions in
   to optimize this. The next step is to integrate these
  optimizations with the SWR fallback in the layout.
overview: "The user initiated a refactoring of  with the goal of
  improving performance and code organization. The agent quickly identified a
  key inefficiency: the  function was being called redundantly, once
  directly and again within . To address this, the agent
  introduced new helper functions in :  to
  fetch team data given a user ID, and  to fetch both user
  and team efficiently. The agent then realized that integrating
   directly into the SWR fallback in  wouldn't
  work as SWR expects individual promises for each data key. The next step
  involves understanding the existing API route structure to correctly implement
  the optimized data fetching with SWR."
