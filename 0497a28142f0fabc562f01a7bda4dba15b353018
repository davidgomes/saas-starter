tldr: The conversation focused on refactoring  to optimize data
  fetching. The main goal was to eliminate redundant  calls and
  improve code organization by fetching user data once and reusing it for team
  data retrieval in the SWR fallback.
overview: "The user initiated a refactoring task for . The
  primary intent was to optimize data fetching within the SWR fallback
  mechanism, specifically to address redundant calls to . The
  approach involved analyzing the existing  and
  functions, identifying that  internally called
  again. To resolve this, a new helper function  was created to fetch team data directly using a user ID. The
   was then updated to include an  function
   that fetches the user once, then uses the
   helper to fetch team data. This optimized setup ensures
   is called only once, improving efficiency and code clarity. The
   was also made  to accommodate awaiting the fallback data."
