tldr: The conversation focused on refactoring  to optimize data
  fetching for SWR fallback. The main goal was to eliminate redundant
   calls by fetching the user once and reusing that data to fetch
  team information efficiently.
overview: "The user requested a refactor of  to improve data
  fetching. The core issue identified was redundant calls to  within
  the SWR fallback mechanism, where  was also calling
   internally. The approach involved first modifying
   to introduce  and
  updating  to utilize it, preventing the duplicate
   call. Subsequently,  was refactored. An initial
  attempt to use an  function to pre-fetch and await data for the SWR
  fallback was corrected. The final implementation involved creating a
   function that initiates a  and then chains
  a  off of it using . This ensures  is invoked
  only once, and the team data is fetched efficiently based on the resolved
  user, providing optimized data fetching for the SWR cache."
