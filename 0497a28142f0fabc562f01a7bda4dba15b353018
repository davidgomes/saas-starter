tldr: The conversation focused on refactoring  to optimize data
  fetching for SWR fallback. The main goal was to eliminate redundant
   calls and improve code organization by chaining promises for user
  and team data.
overview: The user initiated a refactoring task for . The
  primary issue identified was redundant calls to  within the SWR
  fallback configuration, as  internally called
  again. The agent aimed to optimize data fetching and improve code
  organization. After exploring several approaches, including a combined data
  fetching helper, the final strategy involved creating a
  function in . In , a
  function was implemented to first get a promise for user data, and then chain
  a promise for team data using the user ID from the first promise. This
  effectively eliminated the duplicate  call, ensuring efficient data
  fetching for SWR without altering the expected promise-based fallback
  structure.
