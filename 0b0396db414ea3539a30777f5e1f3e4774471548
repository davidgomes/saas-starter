tldr: The user requested to add comments to the  file. The
  assistant successfully added comprehensive comments explaining the Next.js
  middleware's session authentication, route protection, and token refresh
  logic, ensuring no linter errors.
overview: The user's intent was to improve the readability and understanding of
  the  file by adding comments. The assistant approached this by
  first reading and analyzing the existing code to grasp its functionality,
  which includes handling session authentication, protecting dashboard routes,
  refreshing session tokens on GET requests, and redirecting unauthenticated
  users. It then implemented detailed comments throughout the file, explaining
  the purpose of constants, the logic within each function, the overall
  middleware flow, and security aspects of cookie settings. The process
  concluded with a linter check to ensure code quality, which passed without
  errors.
