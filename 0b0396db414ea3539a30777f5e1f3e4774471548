tldr: The user requested to add comments to the  file. The
  assistant successfully added comprehensive comments explaining the Next.js
  authentication middleware's functionality, session management, and security
  aspects, with no linter errors.
overview: The user's intent was to improve the readability and understanding of
  the  file by adding comments. The assistant approached this by
  first reading and understanding the existing Next.js authentication
  middleware, which handles session management, protected routes, and token
  refreshing. It then implemented detailed comments throughout the file,
  explaining each section's purpose, including constants, helper functions, the
  core middleware logic, and security considerations for cookies. The outcome
  was a well-documented  file with no linter errors, enhancing
  its maintainability.
