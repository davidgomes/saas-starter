tldr: The user requested to add comments to the  file. I added
  comprehensive comments explaining constants, functions, the overall middleware
  flow, security considerations, and configuration to improve code readability.
overview: The user wanted to enhance the clarity and understanding of the
   file. This file is a Next.js middleware responsible for
  session cookie management, protected route authentication, and session
  refreshing on GET requests. I added extensive comments to all constants,
  functions, and the main middleware logic, detailing their purpose, parameters,
  and behavior. This also included explanations for security-related cookie
  options and the middleware configuration. After implementing the comments, a
  linter check was performed to ensure code quality.
