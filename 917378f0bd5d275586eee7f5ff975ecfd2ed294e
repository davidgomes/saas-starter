tldr: The user requested to refactor the  and
  files. I analyzed both files, created a refactoring plan, and then implemented
  changes to improve readability, maintainability, type safety, and error
  handling in both files.
overview: "The user initiated a request to refactor two critical files:
   and . My approach involved first reading the
  current content of both files to understand their existing structure and
  identify areas for improvement. I then formulated a refactoring plan,
  outlining specific enhancements such as extracting constants, improving type
  safety, enhancing documentation, and separating concerns into smaller, more
  manageable functions. For , I extracted inline styles into
  named constants, created an explicit interface for props, and added JSDoc
  comments. For , I extracted all magic strings and numbers into
  named constants, created helper functions for route protection, session
  refreshing, and redirection, and improved error handling. The outcome is a set
  of refactored files that are more maintainable, readable, and adhere to better
  software engineering principles."
