tldr: The user requested to refactor the  and
  files. The assistant successfully refactored both files by extracting
  constants, improving organization, adding helper functions, and enhancing
  error handling, resulting in more maintainable and readable code.
overview: The user wanted to refactor the  and
  files to improve their structure and maintainability. The assistant started by
  reading the current content of both files and their dependencies to understand
  the existing implementation. Following this, a refactoring plan was created.
  For , the approach involved extracting metadata into a
   object, defining CSS class names as constants, and introducing a
   interface for better type safety. For , the
  refactoring focused on centralizing all configuration constants into a
   object, extracting logical blocks into dedicated helper
  functions (e.g., , ), and improving error
  handling. The outcome was a set of more organized, readable, and maintainable
  files with clear separation of concerns and enhanced type safety.
