tldr: The user requested to refactor  and . The
  assistant successfully refactored both files by extracting constants, creating
  helper functions, improving organization, and ensuring TypeScript compilation.
overview: "The user initiated a request to refactor two critical files:
   and . The assistant began by thoroughly
  reviewing the existing code and related dependencies to understand the
  context. For , the refactoring focused on extracting magic
  strings into constants, centralizing cookie configurations, and creating
  dedicated helper functions for logic like route protection, sign-in redirects,
  and session refreshing. This significantly improved readability and
  maintainability. For , the refactoring involved organizing
  sections with clear comments, extracting CSS classes into constants,
  introducing a TypeScript interface for props, and encapsulating SWR fallback
  logic into a separate function. During the verification phase, a key decision
  was made to adjust the   export to be a literal object,
  as required by Next.js, after an initial build failure. The final outcome was
  successfully refactored and TypeScript-verified files, enhancing code quality
  and organization."
