overview: The user wanted to add Cursor rules to their Next.js SaaS starter
  project. I started by checking for existing Cursor configurations and then
  thoroughly analyzed the project's  and key source files to
  understand its architecture and conventions. Based on this, I created a
  structured set of Cursor rules within a  directory. These rules
  are organized into several Markdown files, each focusing on a specific aspect
  like general project conventions, Drizzle ORM, authentication, Stripe
  integration, UI components, and API routes. The rules provide detailed
  guidance on best practices, common patterns, and technical specifics, ensuring
  the AI assistant has a comprehensive understanding of the codebase.
