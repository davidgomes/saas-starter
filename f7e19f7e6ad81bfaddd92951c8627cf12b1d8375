tldr: The user requested to add Cursor rules to their project. The assistant
  analyzed the project structure and tech stack, then created a structured set
  of 6 Markdown Cursor (MDC) rule files within a  directory to
  guide the AI assistant on project conventions, database, authentication,
  payments, components, and API routes.
overview: The user wanted to add Cursor rules to their Next.js SaaS starter
  project. The assistant began by checking for existing Cursor configurations
  and then performed a detailed analysis of the project's tech stack and
  conventions by reading key files like , database schema, and
  middleware. Based on this, the assistant decided to create a well-organized
  set of rules. It implemented this by creating a  directory and
  populating it with six distinct Markdown Cursor (MDC) files. These files
  provide comprehensive guidance on general project conventions, Drizzle ORM
  database patterns, JWT authentication, Stripe payment integration, UI
  component patterns, and API route handler best practices. This structured
  approach ensures that the AI assistant has clear guidelines for working with
  different parts of the codebase.
