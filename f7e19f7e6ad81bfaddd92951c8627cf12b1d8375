tldr: The user requested to add Cursor rules to their project. The assistant
  analyzed the project's tech stack and conventions, then created a detailed set
  of Markdown Cursor (MDC) files organized into a  directory,
  covering various aspects of the codebase.
overview: "The user wanted to add Cursor rules to their Next.js SaaS starter
  project. The assistant began by checking for existing Cursor configurations
  and then performed a detailed analysis of the project's tech stack and
  conventions by reading key files like , database schema, and
  middleware. Based on this analysis, which identified technologies such as
  Next.js 15, Drizzle ORM, Stripe, and custom JWT authentication, the assistant
  decided to create a comprehensive set of rules. It implemented these rules by
  creating a  directory with six distinct Markdown Cursor (MDC)
  files. Each file focused on a specific area: general project conventions,
  database patterns, authentication, Stripe payments, UI components, and API
  routes. This structured approach ensures that the AI assistant has clear
  guidelines for interacting with different parts of the codebase."
