tldr: The user requested to add comments to the  file. The
  assistant read the file, understood its purpose as a Next.js session and
  authentication middleware, and then added comprehensive comments explaining
  its various parts and logic.
overview: The user's intent was to improve the readability and understanding of
  the  file by adding comments. The assistant approached this by
  first reading the file to grasp its existing functionality, which involved
  Next.js middleware for session cookie management, protected route
  authentication, and session refreshing. Subsequently, the assistant
  implemented comprehensive comments throughout the file, detailing the purpose
  of the middleware, individual constants, functions, the main logic flow, and
  the configuration. This resulted in a well-documented middleware file that is
  easier to understand and maintain.
