  existing code, which handles Next.js session authentication, protected routes,
  and session refreshing. It then proceeded to add detailed comments throughout

  JSDoc-style comments for functions, a step-by-step breakdown of the main
  middleware logic, and a description of the middleware configuration. The
  process concluded with a linter check to confirm the changes were clean and
