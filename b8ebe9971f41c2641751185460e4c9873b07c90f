tldr: The user requested to add comments to the  file. The
  assistant read the file, understood its session and authentication logic, and
  then added comprehensive comments explaining its purpose, constants,
  functions, and overall flow, ensuring no linter errors were introduced.
overview: The user wanted to improve the readability and maintainability of the
   file by adding comments. The assistant first analyzed the
  existing code to understand its role in handling Next.js session
  authentication, protected routes, and session refreshing. It then
  systematically added detailed comments, including a file-level overview,
  explanations for constants, JSDoc-style comments for functions, and a
  step-by-step breakdown of the main middleware logic. The process concluded
  with a linter check to ensure code quality, confirming the successful addition
  of documentation without introducing errors.
