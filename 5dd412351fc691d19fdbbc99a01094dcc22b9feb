tldr: The user requested to add comments to the  file. The
  assistant successfully added context-rich comments to improve the readability
  and understanding of the session middleware logic, including constants, helper
  functions, and the token refresh flow.
overview: The user wanted to improve the readability of the  file
  by adding comments. The assistant addressed this by adding context-rich
  comments throughout the file. These comments explain the purpose of various
  sections, such as the session cookie setup constants, redirect helpers,
  protected route logic, the session token refresh mechanism, and the global
  middleware entry point. This enhancement makes the code easier to understand
  and maintain without requiring a deep dive into the implementation details of
  each block.
